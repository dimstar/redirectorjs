# redirectorjs

##This handy little guy helps you to create redirections with a regex and a csv file. 

> **I am the redirector**, I create **redirections** from **csv files**

> give me a read file in _argv1_ and an output file in _argv2_, like so:

> `:~$ node redirection.js input-urls.csv my-output.csv`

> give me nothing and that is just what you'll get in return

##Happy redirecting!

This little tool is primary for use with wordpress's yoast plugin and its redirection import. 
Of course you could use it to other ends.
